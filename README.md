# Leaf_Disease_Detection
A deep learning-based project that uses a trained model to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow, and the application provides an interactive interface to upload images, analyze them, and return predictions of the disease type. The project includes a Flask web app for easy deployment.
